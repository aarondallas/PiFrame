*A locally-hosted website to endlessly display animated gifs
pulled from Giphy.com*

Inspired by `this Lifehacker article <https://lifehacker.com/make-an-animated-gif-photo-frame-with-a-raspberry-pi-1658839211>`_

Uses `swipeleft` and `swiperight` event bindings provided by jQuery Mobile to browse to previous and next photos in the loop.
